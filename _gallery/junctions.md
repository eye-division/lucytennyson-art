  A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
  mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
  charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
  mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of
  mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
