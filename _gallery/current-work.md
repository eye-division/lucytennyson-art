  Artist statements


  #### Jane Haigh:&nbsp;"Beyond digital video and traditional painting and
  drawing, lies the new work by JD Haigh, which is site specific to Port Meadow.
  Her work uses editing and layers to suggest the workings of memory meaning and
  time that, like spectres, are so perceptible in our historical places".&nbsp;
